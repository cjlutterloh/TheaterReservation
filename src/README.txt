This folder houses all data for program functionality other than test cases (Theater and database input).

The main function enables primary program functionality in combination with additional objects/classes/data structures contained in the LinkList and UserInfoObject folders.

The UserInfoObject folder provides classes to keep track of 1. orders (to include number and price of tickets for children, adults, and seniors, as well as the location of every seat reserved) and 2. a user (to include all orders a user has made as well as their username and password.

The LinkList folder contains classes to enable a fully functional doubly linked list from scratch. This includes a custom node used to store the row and column location of seats within the theater.
